## Installation Instructions

This mod requires "Minecraft Forge" in order to operate. It is incredibly easy to download and set up, so might as well get to it!

1. Download [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/). Usually "Recommended" is best - you want the "universal", not the source. Forge also has an "install" option now, so all you need to do is launch that program and it will make a lovely Forge profile. If you haven't, look up how to use the installer and the new 1.6.x launcher if you are confused!

2. Download the latest version of BloodMagic from [Curseforge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/blood-magic).

3. Place the mod in the **mods** folder of your .minecraft. If you are unsure of where that is located, it is here: `../Users/you/AppData/roaming/.minecraft`.
